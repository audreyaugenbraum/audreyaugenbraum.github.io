Audrey Augenbraum is a PhD student in the Department of Sociology who studies the humanitarian impulse in the United States. She is currently researching the historical production of legal and moral claims surrounding the reform of US immigration policy. She is also broadly interested in developing computational and network methods for historical research. Prior to coming to Berkeley, she worked as a research coordinator at Columbia University’s Interdisciplinary Center for Innovative Theory and Empirics, where she managed projects on northward migration in the 20th century US, technocrats in Tunisia’s post-revolutionary transition, and liberal arts curricula in the US.
